# NftBuilder
Tool for programmatic randomizing and layering of PNG assets to export as GIF

## In Progress!

This technically isn't an NFT building tool (yet...), but chances are if you're looking to make a common type of NFT bought and sold on OpenSea, you need a tool to take in a set number of traits, varied in rareness, and produce a large number of PNG animation frames containing those multiple layered traits. So this really should be called Automated Categorized PNG Trait Animation Layer Priority Frame Assembling Tool with Controlled Rareness Based Programmatic Randomization...ha! 

It's not quite ready yet...I've tested the code to build PNGs by layer but it is not yet refactored to create the PNGs in App.Main().

### More to follow. Thanks for reading and don't forget to call your mom.
